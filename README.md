## Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in a College Campus using Edge AI
- This solution leverages Edge AI to provide comprehensive insights into vehicle movement and parking patterns on a college campus. 
- It combines vehicle movement analysis, parking occupancy monitoring, and vehicle matching to ensure efficient campus traffic management and security.

## Vehicle Movement Patterns:
- Analyze the frequency and timing of vehicle movement in and out of the campus. 
- Identify peak times and patterns. 
- The solution uses a dataset containing vehicle entry and exit times, along with Python libraries, to analyze the frequency and timing of vehicle movement.

## Parking Occupancy:
- Monitor the occupancy of parking lots in real time. 
- Identify which parking lots are frequently occupied and at what times. 
- The solution uses a dataset containing vehicle occupancy, entry and exit times, parking images, and Python libraries to monitor occupancy and identify frequently occupied parking lots.

## Vehicle Matching:
- Match captured vehicle images and license plates to an approved vehicle dataset. 
- Identify unauthorized vehicles. 
- The solution utilizes license plate detection to compare against an approved vehicle dataset, flagging any unauthorized vehicles.
